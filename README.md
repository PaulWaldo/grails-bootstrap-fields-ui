grails-bootstrap-fields-ui
==========================

Grails Bootstrap Fields UI Set for use with Platform UI.

This plugin is intended to track the [bootstrap-ui plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/bootstrap-ui) with small adjustments to use the [Fields](http://grails.org/plugin/fields) plugin instead of Bean Fields.  This also means it depends on Grails 2+.
